Professional Portfolio of Zander Werner Kuhne
**********************************************


This repository has been created with the goal of tracking my professional development as a software developer.
It  will house various focused projects to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental programming concepts, and is
meant to supplement my CV. This README.md file will also be used as an index of the repository as a whole, along with
a brief description of each project, as well as being updated to include the tools and languages used in the entire repository

Each project directory will contain its own README.md file to document in detail the goal of each project, the challenges encountered,
and the steps taken to overcome these challenges. Commit comments to this repository will also supplement the documentation of each
project, giving brief explanations to changes made or features added.

Tools and Languages

Code Editor: Neovim

I have been using Neovim for most of my development journey, as it is an extremely lightweight editor, allowing me to work efficiently,
even on older hardware. It also integrates perfectly with my OS as I use Linux and rely heavily on terminal commands for system and directory
management. This also means I am comfortable working in environments where a GUI reliant text editor cannot be used.

I am proficient with the editor, and enjoy the tools it provides to:

 -Quickly edit large blocks of code
 -Create global and local "marks" to navigate between project files
 -Use fzf to search for keywords in the system to locate files in large projects
 -Set up macros to speed up creating and replicating repetitive blocks of code
 -Using Oil.nvim to quickly create, modify or remove files in project directories
 -Easy integration with .git functionality, allowing for painless repository documentation and management
 -Easy setup and utilization of virtual environments
 -Easy integration with SSH functionality

.git management:

 -Lazigit

Database management:

 -SQLite
 -DB Browser for SQLite

Language List:

 -Python
 -JavaScript
 -HTML
 -css

To-Do Planner

A CLI application with the aim of setting up and tracking user defined goals, as well as the date these goals were added and their respective
deadlines. This project aims to demonstrate basic CRUD application understanding, along with basic database management functionality to maintain
persistence between different users. Basic encryption is also used for user verification and login management.
