TO-DO Planner

This Python CLI application aims to demonstrate basic understanding of CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications.
It will allow multiple users to set goals they wish to accomplish, while keeping these goals private and persistent with
the use of basic database integration and login verification. It will also keep track of the date these goals were created
as well as their deadlines, promoting urgency and efficient time management. Users can also assign priority levels to each
goal, ensuring that the highest priority goals are always presented first, unless a minimum remaining deadline time for a
goal is approaching, in which case the goal will be pushed to the top of the list, regardless of its priority level. This
concept takes inspiration from triage practice in the emergency medical environment where patients are assigned a triage
rating based on the severity of their conditions, ensuring patients with the most urgent need for medical intervention
are seen to first, while ensuring patients with unstable conditions do not deteriorate further.
